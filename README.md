# localstack-example
Terraform manifest to spawn localstack docker and run sample workload.

[Localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/ )   "...is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment. With LocalStack, you can run your AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider!"

The project spawns _localstack/localstack_ container and then provisions ephemeral EC2 instances via local AWS endpoints.
